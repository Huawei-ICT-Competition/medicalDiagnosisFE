              The accurate classification of Bone X-ray Images is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of bone
              diseases.
              In
              this project, we present a Convolutions Neural Network (CNN) approach for Bone X-ray Image classification
              using
              TensorFlow. Our goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify bone images into their respective
              categories using deep learning techniques. We use image augmentation techniques to increase the
              variability of
              the input data and improve the model's performance.

              Our CNN model has three convolutional layers with max pooling, one dense layer, and a softmax output
              layer. We
              used ReLU activation function in the convolutional layers and the dense layer. We compiled the model with
              the
              categorical cross-entropy loss function and optimized with the Adam optimizer. To prevent overfitting, we
              added
              a dropout layer with a rate of 0.5 after the last convolutional layer.
