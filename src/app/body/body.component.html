        We built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Bone X-ray Image classification using
        TensorFlow.
        The
        CNN
        has three convolutional layers with max pooling, one dense layer, and a softmax output layer. The model is
        compiled
        with
        a categorical cross-entropy loss function and optimized with the Adam optimizer.

        The training and validation data are generated using the ImageDataGenerator class from the TensorFlow Keras
        API,
        which
        applies image augmentation techniques such as rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming, and flipping to the
        training
        data
        to increase the variability of the input data. The images are rescaled to a range of 0 to 1 before being fed
        into
        the
        model.

        The model is fitted on the training data for 20 epochs. A checkpoint is created to save the model with the
        lowest
        validation loss during training. The trained model can then be used to predict the classes of new images.

        The results show the performance of a trained model on both training and validation datasets. The training
        dataset
        has a
        loss of 0.5840 and an accuracy of 0.6763, which means that the model predicted the correct class for 67.63% of
        the
        images in the training dataset, and the average loss for these predictions is 0.5840.

        On the other hand, the validation dataset has a lower loss of 0.4805 and a higher accuracy of 0.8050. These
        values
        indicate that the model has better performance on the validation dataset than the training dataset, which is a
        good sign
        that the model is not overfitting to the training dataset. An accuracy of 0.8050 means that the model was able
        to
        predict the correct class for 80.50% of the images in the validation dataset, and the average loss for these
        predictions
        is 0.4805.

        Overall, these results suggest that the trained model has good performance on the validation dataset, and it
        is
        ready to
        be used for making predictions on new images.
